              Giving birth has a deep psychological impact. It touches us on a
              level that few experiences can. Planning for a birth that is not
              only safe and healthy, but one that is consonant with your value
              system and fits your family’s way of life creates a foundation for
              the long-term physical and emotional wellbeing of parents and
              children. During my six pregnancies, it was vitally important to
              me to be able to engage with my providers in planning birth
              experiences that helped me feel safe, supported, and involved in
              the process. As a coach, it is my goal to empower you to do the
              same. My professional training and experience in psychology and
              wellness coaching, in combination with my Birth Coach Method and
              Lamaze certifications, have prepared me to help expectant parents
              explore their beliefs and fears, clarify their values and
              preferences, and identify ways to achieve their goals.
