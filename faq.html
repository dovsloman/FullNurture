<ul>
  <li><h3>Do you provide labor coaching or birth doula services?</h3><br><p>While I do not coach during the actual labor process, my coaching services help prepare you for labor, birth, and the postpartum period. During transformational birth coaching, you will explore and consider your options for the birth process, including setting and provider, pain management, and routine procedures. You will be supported in making decisions that reflect your value system and preferences, and you will have an opportunity to practice skills and techniques you want to have in place for the birth process.
</p></li><br>
  <li><h3>When should I begin coaching?
</h3><br><p>The sooner, the better! You could even begin before conception, if you would like. It’s best to get started before the 7th month of pregnancy, to give yourself time for the process, but you can still benefit from coaching sessions any time before you go into labor.
</p></li><br>
  <li><h3>Do you offer childbirth education?
</h3><br><p>Yes! As a Lamaze-certified Childbirth Educator, I can incorporate childbirth education into a coaching package, as an add-on service, or you can purchase private childbirth education classes as a stand-alone service.
</p></li><br>
  <li><h3>Do you do postpartum coaching?
</h3><br><p>Absolutely! Several of my coaching packages include postpartum sessions, but I am also available for postpartum coaching even if we haven’t yet worked together. I have a postpartum package that can be added to any of my regular coaching packages, or it can be purchased as a stand-alone service.
</p></li><br>
<li><h3>Can I continue coaching after the postpartum period?
</h3><br><p>Yes. I am trained in health and wellness coaching, productivity and organization, plant-based nutrition, and general habit change. If you find our coaching relationship to be productive, you are quite welcome to continue to continue working with me with a focus on other aspects of life.
